# Naive-Bayes

Objectives for the assignment: 

Change the Gaussian Naive Bayes(which we have seen in class) to discrete Naive Bayes for a random dataset with n = 1000 (# of data points) and d = 2 (# of dimensions) for a binary classification y [0,1]. x1 and x2 can get any values between [0 and 1]. Following is an example of the table which you need to generate:(20 points)
x1	x2	y
0	1	1
0	0	0
1	1	1
1	0	1

Implement the Laplace Smoothing function for the NaiveBayes class. 

Update your Naive Bayes class functions to account for a discrete classification.
